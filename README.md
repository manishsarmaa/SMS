# 🎓 Student  Management System

The **Student Management System** is a comprehensive and relational database model designed to streamline academic record keeping within an educational institution. Built using MySQL, this system efficiently manages information related to students, departments, courses, enrollments, and instructors.

This project is ideal for learning database normalization, SQL queries, and understanding real-world entity relationships within a college environment.
